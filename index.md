My name is Gustav Cappaert. I'm primarily a clinician (physician assistant), but with avid interests in [technology](https://github.com/gcappaert), making, data science, language, and journalism. I used to do some [audio production](https://soundcloud.com/gustav-cappaert/sets/radio-kausay-wasi-materials?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing). 

I'm always up for an interesting project. If you've got one, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:gcappaert@gmail.com).
