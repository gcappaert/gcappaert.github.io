My name is Gustav Cappaert. I'm primarily a clinician (physician assistant), but with avid interests in [technology](https://github.com/gcappaert), data science, language, and journalism. I used to do some [audio production](https://soundcloud.com/gustav-cappaert/sets/radio-kausay-wasi-materials?utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing) and I'm always up for a little project.
